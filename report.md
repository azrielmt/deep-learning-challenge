## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to, " wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, youâ€™ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup", from the Module.

## Preprocessing
- We are looking at data such as the organization, an income amount, the money requested as well as the affiliation.
- We may remove the name and EIN at this point. 

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- We attempted 3 different times and was not able to hit over 75% accuracy.
- I used 100, 60, 25 newurons for this. All of them at "RELU". 
- The steps taking to increase model performance is adding that third layer as well as its neurons.


## Conclusion
I think having more neurons would definitely be more ideal in another layer or so. Some other modifications probably would have been to add another bucket or remove some other columnms as well.
